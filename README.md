# WeMe-App
WeMe React native mobile app

Have you ever felt uncomfortable when a person that you just met, asks for your phone number or social media account? You wouldn't give your address to a stranger. Don't give out your social media or phone number. Instead, use the WeMe messaging app to spawn lightning-fast connections and beam messages without compromising your privacy and safety.

**WeMe is an encrpyted messaging app where users connect using QR codes**
